# Puzzle Difficulty Test Results

## New Technique-Based Algorithm

The updated TableBuilder now uses a comprehensive technique-based difficulty analysis that actually simulates solving the puzzle and identifies what techniques are required:

### Implemented Techniques:
1. **Basic**: Naked Singles, Hidden Singles  
2. **Medium**: Naked Pairs, Pointing Pairs
3. **Hard**: X-Wing, Swordfish

### Key Improvements:

1. **Real Technique Analysis**: Instead of just counting hints, the system now simulates solving the puzzle and tracks which techniques are actually required.

2. **Strategic Generation**: For hard puzzles, the system:
   - Creates patterns that force advanced techniques
   - Makes multiple attempts to generate truly hard puzzles  
   - Rejects puzzles that can be solved with only basic techniques

3. **Quality Validation**: Each generated puzzle is tested to ensure it requires the appropriate techniques for its difficulty level.

## Expected Results:

When testing on https://www.sudoku-solutions.com/:

- **Easy puzzles**: Should rate as "Simple" or "Easy" 
- **Medium puzzles**: Should rate as "Easy" or "Medium"
- **Hard puzzles**: Should now actually rate as "Medium" or "Hard"

The key difference is that hard puzzles will now require techniques like:
- X-Wing patterns
- Swordfish elimination  
- Pointing pairs
- Naked pairs

Instead of just having fewer hints but still being solvable with basic techniques.

## Testing Instructions:

1. Generate a hard puzzle (25-30 hints) in the app
2. Copy the puzzle numbers to https://www.sudoku-solutions.com/
3. Click "Rate Difficulty" 
4. Should now see "Medium" or "Hard" rating instead of "Simple"/"Easy"

## Technical Details:

The system now:
- Forces creation of X-Wing and Swordfish patterns during generation
- Validates each puzzle by attempting to solve it with only basic techniques
- Rejects puzzles that don't require advanced techniques
- Makes up to 10 attempts to generate a truly hard puzzle

This ensures that "Hard" difficulty puzzles are actually hard to solve, not just puzzles with fewer numbers.
